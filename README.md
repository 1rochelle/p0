# Grocery List

## Overview
This is a mess! First of all, this is in C#. Second of all, it isn't connected to an API. However, this is what I have right now so you can at least see what I'll be working on.

## Abstract
This project will eventually utilize user data to compile a smart grocery list: user purchasing data will be analyzed to tell the user what they should buy when they walk into the store, without the user having to take an inventory and make a list. This is a re-hash of an earlier project in C# that I was never able to get off the ground, however, the idea is well hashed-out with lots of ideas for future improvements so I thought it would work well for this project zero assignment.

## Next Steps
I need to download Maven and connect to an API. I will need to create a pox.xml file. I need more logic in my java file, and I need to figure out why my files are uploading to github with a strange filename.
